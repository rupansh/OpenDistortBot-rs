*[OpenDistortBot](https://github.com/rupansh/OpenDistortBot) re-written in rust*

## Why?
I like rust and I wanted to avoid depending on ImageMagick.
The previous project is one of the first programs I wrote and though I improved its code quality, I don't like it.

## Config
Create a `bot-config.toml` while referring to `example-bot-config.toml`

## To-Do
- Improve performance of seamcarving library \
*The current [library](https://github.com/rupansh/seam-carving) is about 3x slower than ImageMagick's implementation with liblqr*

- Sticker support
- Document support
